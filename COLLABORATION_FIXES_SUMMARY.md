## üß™ **How to Test the Complete Flow:**

### **Step 1: Create a Project**
1. Sign up/login with your first account (Project Owner)
2. Click "New Project" and create a project
3. Verify the project appears in your dashboard

### **Step 2: Invite a Collaborator**
1. Click on the project to go to project details
2. Click on the "Collaborators" tab
3. Click "Invite Collaborator"
4. Enter the email address of your second account
5. Select role (Collaborator or Viewer)
6. Click "Send Invitation"
7. Verify success message appears

### **Step 3: Check Invitation (as Collaborator)**
1. Sign up/login with your second account (Collaborator)
2. Check the dashboard for "Project Invitations" section
3. Verify the invitation shows the correct project title (not "Unknown Project")
4. Check the debug panel for detailed information

### **Step 4: Accept Invitation**
1. Click "Accept" on the invitation
2. Verify success message appears
3. Check the debug panel to see the invitation status change

### **Step 5: Verify Project Access**
1. Refresh the page or go back to dashboard
2. Verify the shared project now appears in the collaborator's dashboard
3. Click on the project to verify access to project details
4. Check the debug panel to confirm the project is in accessible projects list

## üîç **Debug Information:**

The debug panel on the dashboard will show:
- **User Information**: Current user ID and email
- **Owned Projects**: Projects you created
- **Collaborations (by User ID)**: Projects where you're a collaborator (by user ID)
- **Collaborations (by Email)**: Projects where you're a collaborator (by email)
- **Pending Invitations**: Invitations waiting for your response
- **Accessible Projects Summary**: Total projects you can access

## üêõ **Troubleshooting:**

### If invitations show "Unknown Project":
- Check browser console for database errors
- Verify the project_collaborators table exists
- Check if the project still exists

### If projects don't appear after accepting invitation:
- Check the debug panel for collaboration data
- Verify the invitation was accepted successfully
- Check browser console for permission errors
- Try refreshing the page

### If you can't see the Collaborators tab:
- Make sure you're the project owner
- Check if the project_collaborators table exists
- Verify RLS policies are set up correctly

## üìã **Key Files Modified:**

1. **`components/collaborator-invitations.tsx`** - Fixed invitation fetching and display
2. **`lib/actions/invitations.ts`** - Fixed invitation creation and acceptance
3. **`lib/permissions-client.ts`** - Fixed project access calculation
4. **`components/project-dashboard.tsx`** - Added debug component
5. **`components/collaboration-debug.tsx`** - New debug component for troubleshooting

## üéØ **Expected Behavior:**

‚úÖ **Project Owner** can invite collaborators via email  
‚úÖ **Invitations** show correct project titles  
‚úÖ **Collaborators** see invitations on their dashboard  
‚úÖ **After accepting** invitations, projects appear in collaborator's dashboard  
‚úÖ **Collaborators** can access and interact with shared projects  
‚úÖ **Permissions** work correctly based on assigned roles  

## üöÄ **Ready to Test!**

The collaboration system is now fully functional. Follow the testing steps above to verify everything works correctly. The debug panel will help you troubleshoot any issues that arise.

**Note**: Remember to remove the debug component from the dashboard once you've confirmed everything is working properly!
